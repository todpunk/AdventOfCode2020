My fiddlings for Advent of Code 2020

I usually stop after about a week and I lose the time vs interest war.

This year I'm applying my limited Go understanding and trying to do a proper packaging organizational strategy, and maybe tests (at least the structure for it will be there).

I may refactor it later, but that's more likely to happen if you create an issue telling me how I should.  =c)
